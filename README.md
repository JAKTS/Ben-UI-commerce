# ui-router


### Starting application 

* run live-server


### Changing styles

* you'll need to install gulp npm install gulp gulp-cli -g
* cd into the directory and run npm install. This will get the dependencies needed for the gulpfile.js
* after you have installed the dependencies the run gulp watch 
* now when you edit the .scss files gulp will compile all your sass files into one .css file called bundle 
* if you want to add a new .scss file look at scss/bundle.scss and follow the same syntax
* DO NOT EDIT THE bundle.css file because it is overwritten everytime you run gulp make all the changes in the scss file
